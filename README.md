## Internal PodCast

This Project is to explore the Go Programming Language. 

**Objective** : To build a internal Audio PodCast , so any registered user can run their own podcasts and all other users can listen to the interested podcast from any of the users.

#### Description

**Server Programme**: Runs a server which collects the user streaming content through browser and publishes it to the url for listen stream.

User should register and use their username and password for streaming.
1. Server receives data and uses a temporary audio file with user name.
2. Listen receives data where the streaming recieves data through the user name. 
3. Written test case to register multiple accounts in register.

**Future Scopes** :

1. Streaming content to listener is not passing correctly to be rectified further.
2. Enhancing front end to adjust listener streaming and store user data in any lite database instead of in memory.
3. No encryption techniques are used. Credentials to be encrypted and communication protocols to be enhanced further for effective work.
